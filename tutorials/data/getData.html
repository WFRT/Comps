<h2>Download data</h2>
GFS forecasts data and METAR observations are available for download in COMPS. Scripts have been made to
retrieve the data and store them in the appropriate folders. <code>$COMPS/input/gfs/download</code>
<code>$COMPS/input/rda336/download</code>.

<p>
To use the download scripts, cd to the directory and run download with the 
<code>./download 20120101</code>. To download multiple days, use the helper script <code>$COMPS/bin/compsDownloadAll 20120101 20121231</code>,
which will download forecasts between Jan 1, 2012 to Dec 31, 2012. Modify the parameters in the download script to specify which forecast offsets
to download.
</p>

<p>
Repeat the same procedure for the METAR data. This data requires you to register on <a href="http://rda.ucar.edu">http://rda.ucar.edu</a>. Place
the username and password in the <code>download</code> file before downloading.
</p>

<p>
To test that the data was downloaded correctly, run <code>./info.exe gfs</code> or <code><code>./info.exe
rda336</code>.
