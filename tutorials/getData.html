<h2>Download GFS and METAR data</h2>
GFS and METAR observations can be downloaded for used in COMPS.

<code>$COMPS/input/gfs/download</code>

<code>$COMPS/input/rda336/download</code>

<p>
To use the download scripts, cd to the directory and run download with the 
<code>./download 20120101</code>. To download multiple days, use the helper script <code>$COMPS/bin/compsDownloadAll 20120101 20121231</code>,
which will download forecasts between Jan 1, 2012 to Dec 31, 2012. Modify the parameters in the download script to specify which forecast offsets
to download.

<p>
Repeat the same procedure for the METAR data. This data requires you to register on <a href="http://rda.ucar.edu">http://rda.ucar.edu</a>. Place
