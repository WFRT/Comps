   <h2>Creating new schemes (Overview)</h2>
   <p>
   A post-processing scheme is represented by a class in the COMPS framework. Each component in COMPS has an abstract base class
   that specifies the functionality that a scheme of that class must implement in order to be used by COMPS.
   </p>
   <p>
   As an example, consider the corrector component.
   </p>
   
   <p>
   There are two strategies for implementing new schemes:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>Extending an existing scheme</li>
      <li>Adding a new scheme</li>
   </ul>

   <h4>Extending an existing scheme</h4>
   This is the simplest approach. An existing scheme can be extended by adding options to the scheme.

   <h4>Adding a new scheme</h4>
   The following steps:
   <ol>
      <li>Add code</li>
      <li>Run <code>$COMPS/init.csh</code></li>
      <li>Add the scheme to schemes.nl</li>
   </ol>
