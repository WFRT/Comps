<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>
Before deciding to contribute your scheme, you should talk to the COMPS maintainers to determine what the best strategy is (i.e. which component
is most suitable and what name to give the scheme).
</p>
<p>
The easiest way to add code is to create a GitHub account and "fork" the COMPS code into your account. Instructions are <a
   href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">here</a>.  Once you are satisfied with the code you have added, you must submit a
"pull-request" to the Github repository. This will ask the COMPS maintainers to merge your code into the main branch of the repository.
