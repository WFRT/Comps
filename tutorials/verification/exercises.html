Use the <code>verif</code> program to answer the following questions.
<p>
<h4>1) Seasonal bias-trend</h4>
Find out if there are any seasonal trends in MAE for the different configurations (hint
<code>-x</code>).
</p>
<p>
<h4>2) Comparison of KF and raw</h4>
Play around with the different verification metrics and try to find reasons why the Kalman filtered
forecasts are better than the raw forecasts.
