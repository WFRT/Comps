   <h2>Overview</h2>
   The easiest option is to use one of the datasets that comes with COMPS. This is a good option for testing new methods. You can also use your own data provided you can convert it into one of
   several supported formats. Finally, you can write your own interface to your data.
   <table class="table table-striped table-condensed">
      <thead>
      <tr><th>Option</th><th>Purpose</th></tr>
   </thead>
   <tr><td> Use existing data</td><td></td></tr>
   <tr><td> Use existing format</td><td></td></tr>
   <tr><td> Create new format</td><td></td></tr>
   </table>
</div>
