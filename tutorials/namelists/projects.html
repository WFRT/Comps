<h2>Your own files</h2>
<p>
As the namelists are often updated between each release of COMPS, we recommend placing custom declarations in a
separate folder. The standard declarations that come shipped with the software are located in
<code>./namelists/default/</code>.
</p>
<p>
As an example, we will create the folder <code>./namelists/custom/</code>. This folder can contain the same
files as you find in <code>./namelists/default/</code> (except for <code>variables.nl</code>). To
refer to lines in these files, the folder name followed by a period is added in front of the names.
</p>

<p>
For example, if a downscaler called "nearest" is defined in
<code>./namelists/custom/schemes.nl</code>, it can be refered in any <code>configurations.nl</code> as
<code>custom.nearest</code>. The same applies to configurations, variable-configurations, and runs defined in
this folder.
</p>

<p>
The option <code>selector=clim</code> refers to the <code>clim</code> line in <code>./namelists/default/schemes.nl</code>. On the other hand, <code>selector=custom.clim</code> refers to the
<code>clim</code> line in <code>./namelists/custom/schemes.nl</code>. This is true for all other references, such as for configurations and variable/configurations.
</p>

Currently, the variables file is not customizable, but this will change in the future.

When running <code>comps.exe</code> you can reference your own runs in the same way, for example <code>./comps.exe 20120101 custom.myrun</code>.

It is fine to mix schemes from the default folder and your own folder, i.e. the following is totally fine: <code>selector=clim correctors=custom.mycorrector</code>.
{% highlight python %}
clim selector=sClim downscaler=custom.dNearest continuous=custom.bpe
{% endhighlight %}
