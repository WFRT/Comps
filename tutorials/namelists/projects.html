<h2>Project folders</h2>
<p>
As the namelists are often updated between each release of COMPS, we recommend placing custom declarations in a
separate folder. The standard declarations that come shipped with the software are located in
<code>./namelists/default/</code>.
</p>.
<p>
As an example, we will create the folder <code>./namelists/custom/</code>. This folder can contain the same
files as you find in <code>./namelists/default/</code>. To refer to lines in these files, the folder name
followed by a period is added in front of the names. Forexample, if a downscaler called "nearest" is defined in
<code>./namelists/custom/schemes.nl</code>, it can be refered in any <code>configurations.nl</code> as
<code>custom.nearest</code>. The same applies to configurations, variable-configurations, and runs defined in
this folder.
