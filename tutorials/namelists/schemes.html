<h2>Schemes</h2>
The schemes available in comps are described in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/schemes/">
<i class="icon-file-alt icon-white"></i> Schemes</a> section. These schemes are defined in C++ code and
compiled. However, many schemes have options that modify their behaviour. These options are specified in
<code>./namelists/default/schemes.nl</code>. The schemes have been grouped into the components defined in
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/schemes/"><i class="icon-file-alt icon-white"></i> Schemes</a>. As an example,
scroll down to the <b>Downscaler</b> section:
{% highlight python %}
# Downscaler
nearest     class=DownscalerNearestNeighbour
distance    class=DownscalerDistance order=2 numPoints=16
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
   Here two downscaling schemes have been set up. First, the nearest neighbour scheme has been defined, and
   given the name <code>nearest</code>. Configurations wishing to use this schemes would use this name to
   refer to it. Below is the declaration of a downscaler that weights nearby grid points.This scheme uses the
   16 nearest neighhours, and weights them based on the square of the inverse distance.
</p>
<p>
   The add a scheme, look up the class name in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/schemes/"><i class="icon-file-alt
   icon-white"></i> Schemes</a> and fill in any of the options.
