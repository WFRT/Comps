<h2>Schemes</h2>
The schemes available in comps are described in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/components/">
<i class="fa fa-gears"></i> Components</a> section. These schemes are defined in C++ code and
compiled. However, many schemes have options that modify their behaviour. These options are specified in
<code>./namelists/default/schemes.nl</code>. This means that two Kalman Filter schemes can be defined but
with different values for its ratio parameter. The schemes have been grouped into the components defined in
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/components/"><i class="fa fa-gears"></i> Components</a>. As an example,
scroll down to the <b>Downscaler</b> section in <code>./namelists/default/schemes.nl</code>:
{% highlight python %}
# Downscaler
dNearest     class=DownscalerNeighbourhood neighbourhoods=n1
dDist16      class=DownscalerNeighbourhood neighbourhoods=n16 weightOrder=2
n1           class=NeighbourhoodNearest num=1
n16          class=NeighbourhoodNearest num=16
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
   Here two downscaling schemes have been set up. First, the nearest neighbour scheme has been defined, and
   given the name <code>dNearest</code>. <b>Configurations wishing to use this schemes would use this name to
   refer to it</b>. This scheme uses the neighbourhood scheme called <code>n1</code>, which is
   also defined in the schemes namelist. The <code>dDist16</code> scheme weights the 16 nearest
   neighbours by the inverse square distance that the points are away.
</p>
<p>
   To add a scheme, look up the class name in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/components/"><i class="fa
         fa-gears"></i> Components</a> and fill in any of the options.
</p>

<p>
The naming convention is to start all selectors with the letter 's', downscalers with 'd',
neighbourhoods with 'n', and correctors with 'c'. More conventions may be added later.
