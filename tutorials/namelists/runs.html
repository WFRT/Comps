<h2>Runs</h2>
The <code>runs.nl</code> file specifies which variable/configurations to produce forecasts for and
sets several other run-related parameters.
{% include Run.html %}
<i class="fa fa-circle"></i> Required: will not run without these<br>
<i class="fa fa-circle-o"></i> Optional.

<p>
<h4>Example</h4>
As an example, consider the following configuration declaration:
{% highlight python %}
tutorial inputs=sineFcst,sineObs varconfs=tutorial outputs=netcdf,verif parameterIo=parNetcdf
{% endhighlight %}
</p>

<p>
Here the tutorial run is defined to use the sineFcst and sineObs input schemes (from
<code>schemes.nl</code>) and produces forecasts for the variable and configuration defined by
<code>tutorial</code> in <code>varconfs.nl</code>. If we wanted to produce several
variable/configurations, then we would append further varconfs to this attribute. COMPS will produce
outputs according to the <code>netcdf</code> and <code>verif</code> output schemes (also defined in
<code>schemes.nl</code>).
