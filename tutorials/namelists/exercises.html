Alter the tutorial run:
<h4>1) Set up your own folder of files</h4>
<p>
Create a new folder called 'custom' in the namelists folder. Duplicate the <code>runs.nl</code> and <code>varconfs.nl</code> files from the default folder (you do not need to duplicate any other
namelist files). From here on you will use the tutorial run defined in this folder (i.e. referenced by <code>custom.tutorial</code>).
</p>

<h4>2) Climatology configuration</h4>
<p>
Add the climatology configuration to the tutorial run, by editing <code>namelists/custom/varconfs.nl</code>. Rerun COMPS to produce the climatology forecasts. How does the climatology
forecasts compare to the persistence forecasts?
</p>

<h4>3) Quantile-quantile</h4>
<p>
Create a new configuration in <code>namelists/custom/configurations.nl</code> using the quantile-quantile correction scheme. Use reasonable schemes for the
other components. The quantile-quantile correction scheme is already set up in the default schemes namelist. Add this configuration to your tutorial runi by editing
<code>namelists/custom/varconfs.nl</code>. Rerun COMPS using this configuration. How does these forecasts compare to the Kalman
filter forecasts?
</p>
<h4>4) Altering the Kalman filter ratio</h4>
<p>
Copy the <code>kf</code> scheme from the default namelist into the schemes namelist in your own folder. Alter the ratio option for the scheme to 1. Create a new configuration in your own folder
that uses this new Kalman filter scheme. Rerun COMPS using this configuration and comment on the results.
