<h2>Configurations</h2>
<p>
   Configurations are defined in <code>./namelists/default/configurations.nl</code>. A configuration is
   composed of the following post-processing components: Selection, correction, discrete and
   continuous uncertainty, and calibration. In addition there are a number of other <br>

</p>
<h4>Options</h4>
<p>
Each configuration has many options that can be specified. The most important ones are:
<code>selector</code>, <code>correctors</code>, <code>continuous</code>, and
<code>lowerDiscrete</code> (for Precipitation). The defaults for the other other options should at
least get you started.

<h4>Example</h4>
As an example, consider the following configuration declaration:
{% highlight python %}
clim selector=sClim downscaler=dNearest continuous=mm1
{% endhighlight %}
</p>

<p>
Here the <code>clim</code> selection scheme, the <code>dNearest</code> downscaler and the
<code>mm1</code> continuous probability model has referenced from
<code>./namelists/default/schemes.nl</code>.
Note that this configuration was named <code>clim</code>, after the selector that it uses. It makes
sense to call the configuration after what it mostly tries to represent.
