<h2>Overview</h2>

      COMPS produces forecasts for using different combinations of post-processing schemes. Definitions of
      configurations are set up in file called namelists. They are located in <code>namelists/</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
      We will start at the bottom. The <code>schemes.nl</code> namelist defines all post-processing schemes
      available.
      </p>
      <p>
      The <code>configurations.nl</code> namelist defines which schemes are combined to form a
      <i>configuration</i>. A configuration is capabale of producing forecast. They are independent of the
      input data, and can therefore be used between several case studies.
      </p>
      <p>
      The <code>varconfs.nl</code> namelist defines which configurations to use for . 
      </p>
      <p>
      Finally, the <code>runs.nl</code> namelist defines which variables to produce forecasts for. Here the
      input datasets are also decided.
      </p>
      <p>
      All namelists are read at runtime. Therefore COMPS does not need to be recompiled after changing
      these files.
      </p>
      <p>
      The files consists of definitions, one per line. The first column is the tag name. After that is a
      series of attribute and values, in the format: <code>attribute1=value1 attribute2=value2</code>.
      Multiple values for one attribute can be specified by separating values by a comma
      <code>attribute=value1,value2</code>, by using ranges <code>attribute=start:end</code>, ranges with
      increments <code>attribute=start:increment:end</code>, or some combination
      <code>attribute=value1,start:inc:end,value2</code>.
