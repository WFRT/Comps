      In the previous tutorial you used COMPS to produce forecasts for several different configurations.
      In this tutorial we will see how we can create new configurations, and chose which to produce
      forecasts for.
      </p>
      <p>
      The forecasts that COMPS produces is governed by a set of files called namelists. There are 4 types
      and work in a hierarchy. A the bottom is a namelist that defines all post-processing schemes
      available in COMPS.
      </p>
      <p>
      The configuration namelist defines which schemes are combined together to form configurations. This
      is where the 4 configurations used in the tutorial are defined.
      </p>
      <p>
      In the tutorial we ran 4 configurations for temperature. In an operational setting you may want to
      produce forecasts for several variables, such as precipitation and wind speed. Different variables
      often use different configurations. The varconf namelist (short for variable-configuration) defines
      which configurations go together with which variables.
      </p>
      <p>
      Finally, the run namelist defines which variable-configurations to use. Here the input datasets are
      specified as well.
      </p>
      COMPS produces forecasts for using different combinations of post-processing schemes. Definitions of
      configurations are set up in file called namelists. They are located in <code>namelists/</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
      All namelists are read at runtime. Therefore COMPS does not need to be recompiled after changing
      these files.

The files consists of definitions, one per line. The first column is the tag name, which <b>must be
   unique</b>. After that is a
series of attribute and values, in the format: <code>attribute1=value1 attribute2=value2</code>.
Multiple values for one attribute can be specified by separating values by a comma
<code>attribute=value1,value2</code>, by using ranges <code>attribute=start:end</code>, ranges with
increments <code>attribute=start:increment:end</code>, or some combination
<code>attribute=value1,start:inc:end,value2</code>.

         A collection of post-processing schemes and other settings that together produce a
         forecast. Different configurations generally produce different forecasts. For
         example a configuration could contain the nearest neighbour downscaler, the analog
         method for selecting an ensemble, the Kalman filter to bias-correct the ensemble,
         and finally the Bayesian Model Averaging method for representing forecast
         uncertainty.

         In addition, the configuration can specify if and what quality control system
         should be used to ensure any observations used are realistic.
