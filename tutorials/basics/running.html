<h2>Running COMPS</h2>
<p>
The COMPS program produces forecasts for one or more 
<ul>
   <li>Specifying which post-processing schemes to use</li>
   <li>Downloading input data</li>
   <li></li>
</ul>
The first step involves changing configuration files in the ./namelists/ folder.
</p>

<p>
This tutorial will produce forecast and compare it against a persistence forecast. The COMPS program
is executed as follows: {% highlight bash %}
$ ./comps.exe 20120101 20120301 tutorial
{% endhighlight %}
where the first parameters (20120101) is start date (in YYYYMMDD format), the second parameter (20120301) is the end date, and the third (tutorial) is a string specifying which run to
execute.
</p>
<p>
This will complete the tutorial run, which creates temperature forecasts for three configurations:
raw, persistence, and kalmanFilter.
</p>
