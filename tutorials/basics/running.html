<h2>Running COMPS</h2>
<p>
The COMPS program is executed as follows:
{% highlight bash %}
./comps.exe <date> <runName>
{% endhighlight %}
This creates forecasts for a specific date (in YYYYMMDD format). In an operational setting,
<code>&lt;date&gt;</code> would be today's date. <code>&lt;date&gt;</code> therefore represents the forecasts
initialization date and not necessarily the date the forecasts are valid for. <code>&lt;runName&gt;</code> is
the name of a run, which specifies what datasets are used to produce the forecasts, for which locations, and
which post-processing schemes to use. You will learn how to specify your own runs in tutorial (2).
</p>

<p>
A tutorial run has been set up, which can be run as follows:
{% highlight bash %}
./comps.exe 20120101 20120301 tutorial
{% endhighlight %}
Note that here two dates are specified, which is a quick way to tell COMPS to produce forecast on all dates
between 2012/01/01 and 2012/03/01, inclusive.
</p>
<p>
The tutorial run creates forecasts for 4 configurations:
<table class="table table-striped table-condensed">
   <thead>
      <tr><th>Configuration</th><th>Description</th></tr>
   </thead>
   <tr><td>Raw</td><td>Raw forecasts from an NWP model</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Kalman filter</td><td>Raw forecasts with Kalman Filter bias-correction</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Climatology</td><td>Uses any observation that is within +/- 15 days of forecast date</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Persistence</td><td>Uses yesterday's observation for the same time of day</td></tr>
</table>

Forecasts and observations are created from a synthetic dataset, which simulates temperature with a diurnal and annual signal.
