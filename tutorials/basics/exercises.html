Use the <code>meteo</code> program to view the tutorial forecasts.
<h4>1) Persistence forecast</h4>
<p>
By viewing forecasts for several consecutive days, verify that the persistence forecast 
is indeed the same as the observations from the previous day.
</p>
<h4>2) Adaptive parameters</h4>
<p>
In the winter time, the raw forecast has a warm bias during the day (around noon). The Kalman Filter tries to fix this problem. On 2012/01/01 the Kalman Filter starts cold, without any
correction. Roughly how many days of training does the Kalman Filter need to correct this bias?
