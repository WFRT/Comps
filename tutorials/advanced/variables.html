<h2>Variables</h2>
COMPS has two types of variables: Base variables and derived variables.

<p>
Imagine a scenario where we are forecasting hourly precipitation(<code>Precip</code>). The input forecast dataset only has accumulated precipitaiton from model initialization. The
<code>variables.nl</code> file for this input has a line indicating the presence of <code>PrecipAcc</code>. When COMPS attempts to pull Precip values from the dataset, it will notice that the
variable does not exist. It will then attempt to diagnose Precip by using the Precip converter defined in <code>./src/Variables/Precip.cpp</code>. This converter will notice that PrecipAcc is
available, and will then take the derivative to arrive at the hourly value.
