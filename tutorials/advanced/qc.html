<h2>Quality control</h2>
<p>
Erroneous values are often present in input datasets. These can create big problems when training the parameters of methods and cause strange output results. COMPS invokes the quality control (QC)
component every time a value is read form an input dataset.
</p>

<p>
The default QC scheme only checks if the value is within a lower and upper boundary, defined for the given variable. This will throw out negative precipitation amounts, or extremely high or low
temperatures.
</p>

<p>
Since QC is a component, more advanced schemes can be added. Multiple QC schemes can also be daisy-chained, requiring an input value to pass multiple QC checks.
