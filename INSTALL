Step 1) Run the configure script, which sets up compilation flags specific to your hardware (flags.mk)
./configure

Step 2) Compile the program. If successful, this will create comps.exe, info.exe, convert.exe, comps_debug.exe,
        and convert_debug.exe. The first three are optimized, and the last two can be used for debugging with gdb.
