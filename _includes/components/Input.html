   Inputs are sources of weather information. Inputs have <b>6-dimensional</b> data that can be
   observations or model output (forecasts). Inputs provide data for different dates, hours,
   locations, and variables. Data from forecast also have an initialization time and can contain
   multiple ensemble members.
</p>
<p>
   Input data can be provided in a variety of formats. The easiest is a simple text format
   (<code>InputFlat</code> below), which uses one row for each forecast horizon, and one column for
   each ensemble member. COMPS supports weather forecasts in the standardized Netcdf file-format,
   with <a href="http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/">CF</a> naming conventions (<code>NetcdfCf</code> below).
</p>
<p>
   Inputs can also simulate weather information. For example, <code>InputSinusoidal</code>
   produces a sinusoidal signal of a set frequency and amplitude. This is useful to test the
   performance of schemes against expected outcomes. Similarly, <code>InputLorenz63</code> simulates
   a simple 3-state model of atmospheric convection.
</p>
<p>
   Using your own observation or forecast data requires formatting the data into one of these
   formats. Alternatively, a new input scheme can be created that reads your custom format.
