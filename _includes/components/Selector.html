Typically an ensemble is constructed by selecting forecast from different runs. We have generalized this consept by
allowing forecasts&mdash;or observations&mdash; from different initialization dates and times, datasets, and forecast
horizons. In this way, climatology and persistence ensembles can be created as well as lagged-time ensembles.
